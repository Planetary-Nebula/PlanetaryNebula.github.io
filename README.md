This is not an official release.

This repository was for a Computer Science Final Project.

Do not take this seriously as only about 95% of this project was made purely by myself, with help from Brandon Xu, Ethan McManus and the Youtube Channel "Kenny Yip Coding" 
for the information on making the flag and bomb buttons interactable.
